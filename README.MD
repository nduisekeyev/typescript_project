# TypeScript Project

In TypeScript, both types and interfaces are used to define custom data structures, but there are some differences in how they work and in their intended use cases.

## Types vs Interfaces

    1. Declaration Syntax
    2. Extending/Implementing
    3. Declaration Merging
    4. Compatibility

## Installation

Install my-project with npm

```bash
  npm install typescript_project
  cd typescript_project
  npm run dev
```
